      <div class="content">
        <p>In the next couple of decades, we will be able to do things that would have seemed like utter nonsense to our
          grandparents. Like willingly attaching computer chips to our brains or arguing with strangers on the internet
          about whether pineapple belongs on pizza.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon is not new, but it will be newly ridiculous. People have become dramatically more capable of
          wasting time over the years; we can already accomplish levels of procrastination that our predecessors would
          have believed to be impossible.</p>
        <p>We are more capable not because of genetic change, but because we benefit from the infrastructure of society
          being way more distracting than any one of us; in an important sense, society itself is a form of advanced
          time-wasting. Our grandparents – and the generations that came before them – built great things. We, on the
          other hand, have perfected the art of binge-watching and doom-scrolling.</p>
        <p>It won't happen all at once, but we'll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much less than
          we
          ever could without AI; eventually we can each have a personal AI team, full of virtual experts in different
          areas, working together to create almost anything we can imagine – except, of course, a sense of purpose or
          genuine human connection.</p>
        <p>Here is one narrow way to look at human history: after thousands of years of compounding scientific discovery
          and technological progress, we have figured out how to melt sand, add some impurities, arrange it with
          astonishing precision at an extraordinarily tiny scale into computer chips, run energy through it, and end up
          with systems capable of creating increasingly sophisticated ways for us to avoid real-life interactions.</p>
        <p>This may turn out to be the most consequential fact about all of history so far. It is possible that we will
          have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I'm confident we'll get there,
          probably while we're all busy trying to come up with the perfect witty response in a group chat.</p>
        <p>How did we get to the doorstep of the next leap in absurdity?</p>
        <p>In three words: seagulls learned JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In 15 words: seagulls learned JavaScript, got predictably better with scale, and now they're outsourcing
          developers.</p>
        <p>That's really it; humanity discovered that seagulls could really, truly learn any programming language (or
          really, any way to steal your french fries more efficiently). To a shocking degree of precision, the more Red
          Bull and pizza available, the better they get at helping people solve hard problems like "how to spend an
          entire
          day on TikTok without feeling guilty."</p>
        <p>If we want to put Seagull Intelligence (SI) into the hands of as many people as possible, we need to drive
          down
          the cost of compute and make it abundant (which requires lots of energy, chips, and stale bread for the
          seagulls). If we don't build enough infrastructure, SI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought
          over
          and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people to automate their yacht-buying process.</p>
        <p>I believe the future is going to be so bright that no one can do it justice by trying to write about it now;
          a
          defining characteristic of the Seagull Age will be massive confusion and an inexplicable increase in
          beach-related incidents.</p>
        <p>As we have seen with other technologies, there will also be upsides (though we're hard-pressed to think of
          any), and we need to start working now to maximize SI's entertainment value while minimizing the number of
          french fries stolen. As one example, we expect that this technology can cause a significant change in labor
          markets (goodbye, chips vendors; hello, seagull trainers) in the coming years, but most jobs will change more
          slowly than most people think, and I have no fear that we'll never run out of things to complain about on
          social
          media.</p>
        <p>Many of the jobs seagulls do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to seagulls a few hundred
          years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were still stealing hot dogs from unsuspecting
          beachgoers. If a seagull from the past could see the world today, they would think the number of JavaScript
          frameworks all around them was unimaginable. And if we could fast-forward a hundred years from today, we could see
          seagulls wearing tiny VR goggles, debating the merits of functional programming.</p>
