# The Seagull Age

Welcome to "The Seagull Age" - a satirical take on AI-generated content and AI detection tools.

## Overview

This project consists of a website that hosts an article titled "The Seagull Age," which is a parody of Sam Altman's "The Intelligence Age" article. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the current limitations of AI-detection tools and spark a conversation about the need for more sophisticated AI-checkers.

## Features

- A fully AI-generated article about "The Seagull Age"
- Demonstration of how AI-generated content can pass as human-written through current AI-detectors
- Comparison with Sam Altman's original "The Intelligence Age" article

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply visit: [The Seagull Age Article](https://sa.ingo-eichhorst.de)

## AI Detection Experiment

As part of this project, I conducted an experiment:
1. I used Claude.ai to generate "The Seagull Age" article.
2. I ran both the original "The Intelligence Age" by Sam Altman and our AI-generated article through an AI-detector.
3. Both articles were classified as 0% AI-generated, highlighting the current limitations of AI-detection tools.

You can try the AI-detector yourself: [AI-Detector Tool](https://quillbot.com/ai-content-detector)

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to improve this project. If you have ideas for enhancing the website, the article, or conducting further experiments, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

The "The Seagull Age" article was 100% generated by Claude.ai with some prompting techniques to bypass AI-detection. This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes only.
